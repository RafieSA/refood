# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Deploy the ReFood Laravel 11.x restaurant discount platform to Microsoft Azure production environment using $100 free credits with Supabase as the database backend.

## Key Knowledge
- **Project**: ReFood - Laravel 11.x restaurant discount platform with WCAG 2.1 Level AAA accessibility features
- **Architecture**: PHP 8.2, Laravel 11, Tailwind CSS, Supabase integration, MySQL fallback
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with local MySQL fallback, 100+ restaurants, 500+ menus, 300+ discounts
- **Key Features**: Restaurant discovery, discount claiming system, interactive maps, customer service via WhatsApp, admin dashboard
- **Deployment Target**: Azure App Service (refood-bvbqbqa3a9gfh8e4.southeastasia-01.azurewebsites.net) with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- **Environment Variables Required**: APP_KEY, DB_CONNECTION=supabase, SUPABASE_URL/KEY, MAIL configuration, FORCE_HTTPS=true
- **Azure Credentials**: FTP credentials available for manual deployment (host: waws-prod-sg1-111.ftp.azurewebsites.windows.net, username: refood\$refood, password: koaAswkafn1iYcrtsPtihzD2nnyyJqppMlR0Sp0rt9kMsoe8rQsCJoltiv0F)

## Recent Actions
- **Environment Setup**: Completed Azure environment variables configuration including APP_KEY generation
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Created GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/main_refood.yml) for automated deployment
- **Migration API**: Added secure migration endpoint (routes/migration-api.php) for post-deployment database operations
- **Routing Configuration**: Updated bootstrap/app.php to include migration API routes
- **Database Decision**: Chose Supabase over Azure MySQL for cost efficiency and existing integration
- **GitHub Secrets**: Successfully configured AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME, AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE, and MIGRATION_TOKEN
- **Deployment Attempts**: Multiple GitHub Actions deployment attempts showing successful deployment but Laravel app not accessible
- **Root Cause Identified**: Azure App Service default document configuration issue - files deployed successfully but web server not routing to public/index.php
- **Web Config Created**: Added web.config file for proper IIS/Nginx routing configuration

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Generate and configure APP_KEY for production
2. [DONE] Create GitHub Actions deployment workflow
3. [DONE] Setup migration API endpoint
4. [DONE] Configure GitHub secrets (AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME, AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE, MIGRATION_TOKEN)
5. [DONE] Download Azure publish profile from Deployment Center
6. [DONE] Push code to trigger automated deployment
7. [IN PROGRESS] Manual FTP upload via FileZilla to bypass GitHub Actions complexity
8. [TODO] Test production deployment and database connectivity
9. [TODO] Verify Supabase integration in production environment
10. [TODO] Configure production environment variables in Azure App Service

## Next Immediate Steps
- Execute manual FTP upload using FileZilla with provided credentials
- Test Laravel application accessibility at https://refood-bvbqbqa3a9gfh8e4.southeastasia-01.azurewebsites.net
- Configure production environment variables in Azure App Service Configuration
- Run database migrations via migration API endpoint
- Verify all core functionality in production environment

## Critical Issue
GitHub Actions deployment reports success but Laravel application not accessible due to Azure App Service default document configuration. Manual FTP deployment recommended as immediate solution to bypass deployment pipeline complexity.
